### Contributions
- **Abdullah** connected the Fibonacci and Odd functions into the final IsFibonacciOdd.asm program..
- **Anthony** wrote the final version of the README file explaining how the full program works.
- **Mohamed** uploaded the final combined code to GitHub.
- **Alan** assisted with testing and verifying the final program's correctness.

### How to run the program
1. Launch the MARS IDE (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
2. In the top menu bar, click on **File -> Open** and select the desired file.
3. After the file is loaded into the Editor window, you may want to check if a specific number is odd. To do so, modify the integer on line 7 to the value you want to check for odd or even.
4. To calculate the number, run the program by clicking on **Run -> Assemble** in the top menu bar.
5. The result can be found in the right side panel in register `$v0` in the *Value* column.
    - A value of 0 indicates the number is even.
    - A value of 1 indicates the number is odd.

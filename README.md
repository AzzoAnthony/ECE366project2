### How to run the program
1. Launch the MARS IDE (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
2. In the top menu bar, click on **File -> Open** and select the desired file.
3. After the file is loaded into the Editor window, you may want to calculate a specific Fibonacci number. To do so, change the value on line 3 to a desirable number.
4. To calculate the number, run the program by clicking on **Run -> Assemble** in the top menu bar.
5. The result can be found in the right side panel next to register `$t1` in the *Value* column.
